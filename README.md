# Fractal Trees

## Introduction

Fractal Trees refers to a class of fractals that are generated by recursively applying a set of rules to a starting shape. The rules are applied to the starting shape to generate a new shape. The rules are then applied to the new shape to generate another shape. This process is repeated until the desired level of detail is reached.

## Installation

To run the simulation, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. Alternatively, you can visit the [GitHub Pages](https://ghostscypher.github.io/dijkstra/fractal_trees/index.html) for this repository.

## Implementation

This is a very simple implementation of fractal trees. We can be more fancy and use a more complex set of rules to generate more complex fractal trees. We can also use a more complex starting shape to generate more complex fractal trees. E.g. (Code Train - Fractal Trees)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcdNSZ9IzJM] uses objects to represent the branches of the tree with position, angle, and length. This data allows us to manipulate the branches of the tree more easily.

### Pseudocode

```pseudo
function drawTree(x, y, length, angle, depth) {
    if (depth > 0) {
        drawBranch(x, y, length, angle);
        drawTree(x, y, length * ratio, angle + 30, depth - 1);
        drawTree(x, y, length * ratio, angle - 30, depth - 1);
    }
}
```
